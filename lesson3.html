            <h2>Tennis</h2>
            <p>Tennis is a popular sport played individually (singles) or in teams (doubles), where players use a racket
                to hit a ball over a net onto the opponent's side of the court. The objective is to score points by
                making the ball land in the opponent's designated area, while the opponent fails to return it correctly.
                The game can be played on various surfaces, including grass, clay, and hard courts, each offering
                different playing characteristics. Tennis matches are typically structured in sets, and players must win
                a set by claiming six games, with at least a two-game lead. In the event of a tie in sets or games,
                tie-breaks or other rules may come into play.
                Tennis is known for its fast pace and the skill required to rally effectively. It demands physical
                endurance, precision, mental focus, and tactical awareness. Professional tennis features major
                tournaments such as the Grand Slam events: the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open,
                which are considered the pinnacle of the sport.
                Some of the most famous tennis players include Roger Federer, Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, Novak
                Djokovic, and Martina Navratilova.</p>

            <h2>Swimming</h2>
            <p>Swimming is a popular and versatile sport that involves moving through water using one’s body. It can be
                done recreationally for fitness, relaxation, or competition. Swimming is one of the few sports that can
                be performed both individually or as a team.
                In competitive swimming, athletes race in various styles or strokes: freestyle (front crawl),
                backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. Swimmers compete in races of different distances, ranging from
                sprints to long-distance events, usually in a pool or open water.
                The key to swimming success involves proper technique, strength, stamina, and coordination. Swimmers
                must also be able to adjust to the challenges presented by water conditions, including temperature, wave
                size, and visibility when swimming in open water.
                The sport is not only a competition but also a lifesaving skill, with benefits such as improved
                cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and flexibility. It's a low-impact sport, making it suitable for
                people of all ages and fitness levels.
                In addition to competitive events, swimming is a major part of multi-sport events like the Olympic
                Games, with legendary athletes such as Michael Phelps, Katie Ledecky, and Ian Thorpe gaining
                international fame for their achievements in the pool.</p>

            <h2>Running</h2>
            <p>Running is one of the simplest and most accessible forms of physical exercise and sport, involving moving
                at a fast pace on foot. It can be done as a recreational activity or in competitive settings, ranging
                from short sprints to long-distance marathons.

                In competitive running, events are categorized by the distance to be covered, including:

                Sprints: These are short-distance races, typically from 60 meters to 400 meters. The focus is on
                explosive speed and power.
                Middle-distance races: Events like the 800 meters and 1500 meters require a balance of speed and
                endurance.
                Long-distance races: These include events like the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, where endurance plays
                a larger role.
                Marathons: A marathon is a 42.195-kilometer (26.2 miles) race that demands extreme endurance, with
                runners needing to maintain a steady pace over long periods.
                Ultramarathons: These are races longer than the marathon, often held on challenging terrains, and can
                range from 50 kilometers to over 100 kilometers.
                Running provides numerous physical and mental health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health,
                weight management, enhanced mood, and stress reduction. It's a full-body workout, strengthening leg
                muscles, improving stamina, and boosting overall fitness.</p>
